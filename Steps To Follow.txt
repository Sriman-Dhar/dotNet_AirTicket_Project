Here's an outline of the steps you can follow to update your project:

Create Models: Define all your model classes based on your database structure.
Create DbContext: Implement the AirTicketContext class that derives from DbContext and includes DbSet properties for each of your model classes.
Create Repositories: Implement repositories for each of your entities based on your reference code.
Create Services: Implement services for each of your entities based on your reference code.
Implement AutoMapper: Configure AutoMapper to map between DTOs and models in your services.
Create Controllers: Implement API controllers for each entity, where you use the corresponding service to handle HTTP requests and responses.
Configure Dependency Injection: Set up dependency injection to inject services into your controllers.
Test APIs: Test your APIs using tools like Postman.
For each of these steps, I recommend starting with smaller parts and gradually building up your project. If you encounter specific issues or need assistance with a particular part, you can share the relevant code and describe the problem you're facing, and I'll be glad to help.

If you need assistance with any of the specific steps, feel free to ask!




You have the following queries left:

EmployeeRepo.cs: You'll need to implement the CRUD operations for the Employee entity along with its associated records (EmployeeMail and EmployeeSalary).

FlightInfoRepo.cs: Implement the CRUD operations for the FlightInfo entity.

FlightManageRepo.cs: Implement the CRUD operations for the FlightManage entity.

LocationRepo.cs: Implement the CRUD operations for the Location entity.

ReservationRepo.cs: Implement the CRUD operations for the Reservation entity along with its associated records (TicketInfo).

TicketInfoRepo.cs: Implement the CRUD operations for the TicketInfo entity.

CustomerContactRepo.cs: You've mentioned creating this repo earlier. If you haven't implemented it yet, you need to do so for the CustomerContact entity.

CustomerInfoRepo.cs: Similarly, if you haven't implemented this repo yet, you need to do so for the CustomerInfo entity.

CustomerRepo.cs: Even though you've implemented it, you might want to revisit this repo to ensure that all methods are correctly implemented based on your updated requirements.

EmployeeMailRepo.cs: Implement the CRUD operations for the EmployeeMail entity.

EmployeeSalaryRepo.cs: Implement the CRUD operations for the EmployeeSalary entity.

AdministrationRepo.cs: You've implemented it earlier, but make sure it aligns with your updated requirements.

Remember, for each of these repositories, you'll need to follow the pattern of handling associated records and wrapping operations in transactions to ensure data integrity. Please adapt the patterns and codes I provided earlier for the CustomerRepo.cs as a guide.
